Form: 
  How to take form values to JS

Promise:
  Object to understand the completion(or failure) of an asynchronous event/operation

  MDN-> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

  State:
    pending --->  initial state, neither fulfilled(success) nor rejected(failure).

    fullfilled ---> meaning that the operation was completed successfully with a value

    rejected ---> meaning that the operation failed with a reason

  methods:
    then ---> executed when the promise is fullfilled/resolved
    catch ---> executed when the promise is rejected/unfullfilled
  
  Chaining --> returning an promise from resolvement in parent promise
    execution time --> sum of time taken by all promise chains
  All --> Independent Promise triggered simultaneously/parallel
    execution: Maximum time among promises
  Any --> trigger independent promises
    resolve is success when any one is resolved
  
  error:
    what is an error? ---> syntax, typeerror
    when does an error occur?
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error
  try --> block of Codes which prone to throw an error
  catch --> catches error occured on try block
  finally --> executes after try/catch ( used for some cleanup or msg display purpose )

Fetch & then
  Fetch -> Interface to make an api call
    then ---> response --> convert response to json -> promsie .then (json -> operation on json)
